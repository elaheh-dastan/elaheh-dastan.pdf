## Acknowledgement

Based on [1995parham.pdf](https://github.com/1995parham/1995parham.pdf) structure.

## Descriptions

During applying for jobs procedures, you may need to write down a short description about yourself which
could be useful for another companies too.

Each paragraph in the each following section can be used standalone.

### Awards

I ranked below 400 in the math and physics university entrance exam in Iran, with over 1 million participants.
My team and I successfully published a paper, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09830.
My team and I participated in a Hackathon, where we performed sentiment analysis on tweets about the company,
securing the third position among 30 teams. You can find our project at https://github.com/elahe-dastan/Fallgoosh.

### Technical Achievements

One of the recent achievements I take pride in is implementing ETA predictions using ML models and successfully deploying them not only in Iran but also in Iraq.
I spearheaded this project from its conceptualization, successfully persuading both the Product team and stakeholders. Over the past three quarters,
our ML models have seamlessly replaced routing engines in Gilan and Shiraz, Iran, as well as Baghdad and Basra, Iraq.
In addition to addressing accuracy and pattern challenges, we've significantly improved response times and reduced the required storage capacity.

I learned about blockchain in my first year of university and found it fascinating. I delved into papers on coin mining and how blockchain functions.
During my university years, I spent 6 months contributing to Rasa Technology and Innovation Center, focusing on creating smart contracts using IBM Hyperledger Fabric.
While I didn't list this internship on my resume, I think it aligns well with your company's goals.
With extensive experience in my preferred language, Golang, I believe I can bring valuable contributions to your team.
